# Kollegium Frontend

## Prerequisites
* nodejs >= 14.17.6 ([https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
```bash
$ node -v
```

## Installation
* clone repo
* npm install


## Workflow

Open two terminals.

### Start development environment
in the first terminal:
```bash
$ npm run development
```
This starts the development server with automatic live rebuild and reload.  

### Build for production
in the second terminal:
```bash
$ npm run production
```
This builds the application and exports the the `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files to the `dist` directory. These files are ready to upload to a production webserver.

Enjoy!
